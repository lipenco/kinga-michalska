            <p class="projectTags">Studio portraits of women from Poland in their late '30 and early '40. The goal of this project is to make women feel beautiful and feminine, and to help them accept their bodies. I use the camera to show my models that there are many ways of looking at their body and one of them is to look at it with love and respect. </p>
